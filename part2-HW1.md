EdX class on SaaS

Was surprised by the home as it really didn't go into what the lectures were about, no database work at all. It was good to go through the process of creating a small application to connect to a web service.  Wish it was using JSON format as that is what I see most of the time now.  Is this really a REST service or is this more like RPC over http?
