Remote pairing is an interesting topic.  I found that I can technically create sessions and conduct pairing, but at this time I prefer to do solo programming.  I will obtain more practice/attempts at remote pairing as I continue in the class.  Since I am so new to ruby, much of my time for this current homework assignment was spent looking a reference to find out how to properly iterate through collections (in this case arrays).  Remote pairing probably would have had my partner tell me the answers, when it was much more valuable at this lower level of undestanding if I just did the reference work myself.
