Unfortunately, timing didn't work out for me this time.  I ended up not being ready to submit until the very 
possible last moment due to family obligations, so I was not able to complete pair programming on this assignment.
This would have been a great candidate for pair programming, however.  Rails is new to me, so I had quite a bit
of ramp-up that I needed to do.  I first attempted the homework without working through chapter 4 in the book. 
I choose to just proceed with the material I gathered from the lecture videos, but that was not enough.  I have
a background in Java, so the concept of convention over configuration really threw me off.  I made the assignment
much more difficult than it needed to be.  If I was pairing, I assume my partner would have been able to ask
the right questions to get my thinking back into the ruby and rails way of doing things.
