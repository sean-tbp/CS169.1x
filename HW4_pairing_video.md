I didn't pair program on this assignment.  I really like the way cucumber guides you through the steps necessary to get the proper elements created to make a feature work.  TDD is still kind of backwards to me, I still rely on running the application to see what is broken as I don't seem to get all the information I need out of the failures.  It's probably because I'm not designing my test cases properly.  I had to go back and add more tests to bump up the code coverage after the fact.
