CS169.1x HW3 Pairing Notes
========

Interesting working with cucumber.  I like how it is driven by english narratives of the steps in the .features file.  I did find it quite difficult to get the regular expressions correct, and I am still not familiar enough with the ruby syntax.  I find that I have quite a few errors I need to fix, thank goodness for stack overflow.
